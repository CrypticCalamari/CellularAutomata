The code you see here is currently developed in the context of
Google Apps Scripts in order to get it published online through
Google Sites, since I'm poor.

Keeping that in mind I've had to find workarounds for various
problems, since Google Apps Scripts uses Caja to sanitize the
script. I want to use SVG for icons and such in the final
version, but Caja currently prevents that in Google Apps Scripts.
Other things that don't seem to work due to Caja is double
buffering. I'm sure there is a work around to the simple method
that uses context.drawImage(buffer), but currently that isn't an
option.
